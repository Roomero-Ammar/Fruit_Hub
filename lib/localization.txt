To Use Flutter localization after insall the package in yaml
- then in main file write this down MaterialApp( :-
 localizationsDelegates: const [
        S.delegate,
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
      ],
      supportedLocales: S.delegate.supportedLocales,
      locale: const Locale('ar'),
---------------
  Write in the search bar in VS Code:
# > Flutter Intl : Initialize
# we should add (generate : true) in yaml down flutter:

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  generate: true
 ---------
 create l10n.yaml file to don't use the command of flutter gen-l10n :

 arb-dir: lib/l10n
template-arb-file: intl_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
output-class: AppLocalizations
preferred-supported-locales:
  - en
  - ar
----------
flutter gen-l10n
# we use this commands to generate localization files after insall extention from VS Code calls "Flutter Intl"
          ___________________________________________
/////    -Another Way to use localization in flutter-  ////////
                       >>Better Way<<
          ___________________________________________

   >    install this package in yaml file: flutter pub add intl_utils
      
      > we don't write additional code in main file we just create new main file (l10n.yaml) and write this inside it:-

arb_dir: lib/l10n
template_arb_file: intl_en.arb
output_dir: lib/generated

# then we write this command in terminal:

flutter pub run intl_utils:generate

to add local language file we write this in search bar after download the extention of "flutter intl"

> Flutter Intl : Add Local
